# FF6-PR-Cursor-Sound-change
Currently a place to post my investigative work on finding a way to change the default cursor sound in FF6 Pixel Remaster

I Love the original cursor sound in FF6 for SNES, but the one for the Pixel remaster is ear piercing and kinda jarring, if I'm going to relive my favorite Final Fantasy, I want that beautiful cursor sound to grace my ears the whole time.

This repo is where I'm going to store my findings as I dive into my first ever mod.
